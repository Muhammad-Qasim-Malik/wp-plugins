# Backstage by MQ

**Backstage by MQ** is a WordPress plugin designed to simplify the process of managing background images for your products. Instead of dealing with thousands of individual product images, the plugin allows the admin to upload and manage **one single background image**. This image can be easily applied across the site, saving time and effort, especially when changes to the design are required.

## Features

- **Single Background Image Management**: Upload only one image that will be used as the background across your website, eliminating the need to manage thousands of images.
- **Simple Design Changes**: When the design needs to change, simply replace the background image without having to redesign or upload multiple product images.
- **Post Title & Logo Display**: Use a shortcode to display the post title and logo over the background image.
- **Customizable Styling**: Fully customizable styling via CSS for adjusting the appearance of the title, logo, and background.
